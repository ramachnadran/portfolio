      description: "Started as an intern and transitioned to full-time role, working on multiple educational technology projects. Developed OMR scanner for automated exam processing that scans student answer sheets and extracts data including student name, class, roll number, questions attempted, correct/incorrect answers, and marks within one second. Built OCR attendance system for schools to track student presence automatically. Created question paper assembly page with chapter split table functionality using PHP for legacy products. Implemented misconception explanation and remedial instruction features for questions. Developed comprehensive APIs for question management (add, delete, edit, update) using Python. Built LLM-powered textbook analysis system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract chapters, topics, subtopics, and questions with marks based on subject and class. Resolved multiple production bugs in legacy systems and created dynamic HTML reports for teachers. Currently working on CORE platform projects including textbook mapping APIs using Node.js for internal users and teachers, developing 20+ notification scenarios for email notifications, and building AI-powered audio reports using Claude AI and Eleven Labs API for teacher performance analysis."
